The mass of the earth is about $6Ã—10^{24} kg$. Hence, unrestrained objects near its surface accelerate towards the center of mass at $9.8ms^{-2}$, more or less. That acceleration also translates into euphoric sensations, especially when vectored by terrain and a low friction interface construed by mechanical or other means.

Tucson can have nice sunsets. It's a place that might be interesting to stay a while.

I had never seen Saguaro before, not in a natural setting. Fascinating plants.

It rained most of the way between Tucson and Las Vegas. The scent of rain in a dry climate opens many memories.

Death Valley and surrounds. It was 44Â°C at about 7pm in Furnace Creek. Slept out that night, surprisingly pleasant with a hot, dry breeze all night providing evaporative cooling.

Big sky out west, making some drama. Stopped by Mono Lake for a quick look around the landscape I had never visited before. The mineral formations were surreal.

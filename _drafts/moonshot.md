There's a [lunar eclipse](https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/lunar/2018-january-31) starting at 2018-01-31T10:51:13Z which equates to 05:51:13ET.

The moon will be below the horizon on the East Coast before the full eclipse happens, but the view may be interesting, and the weather is forecast to be clear and possibly crisp if the snow showers move out in time.

The late onset of the eclipse means a view with a low horizon is needed (not difficult in Maryland...) and ideally there should be some feature to include in the image near the horizon.

One possibility is a view across Annapolis Harbor.

The ephemeris shows that the moon should set pretty close by the state house, which might provide a bit more interest on the horizon.
